<h2>Project Description & Outline</h2>

American society is approaching one year since the onset of Coronavirus in the United States and changed everyone’s lives. For months, scientists were working hard to create a vaccine that could combat this virus. With the Johnson & Johnson vaccine being released in late February, the world now has three vaccines available to the public and vaccination rates are rising fast.

The purpose of this project is to analyze the COVID-19 data from January 2021 related to new cases, new tests per day, mortality rate and the vaccination rate in the US.  This information will be used to predict trends for each of these statistics in the upcoming month.  

<h4>Analysis Questions:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Is the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the US decreasing as individuals are receiving the COVID-19 vaccine?
<li>Is there a difference in the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in those states that have a higher number of people vaccinated compared to those that have a lower number of people vaccinated?
<li>Do the current trends regarding the COVID-19 pandemic appear to be improving (i.e. new daily cases decreasing and vaccinations increasing)?
</ol>

<h4>Data Analysis Approach</h4>

We hope to use Python Pandas to clean the data, as well as Javascript Plotly to visually graph out the data.  For machine learning, we plan on utilizing Scikit-Learn. 

<h4>Dataset Sources</h4>
